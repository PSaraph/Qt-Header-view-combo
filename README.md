# Qt-Header-view-combo
Basic sample describing use of sorting on a elementary tree model based on selected value in a headerview combobox
Books.xml is present as a very minimal sample. This is kepy trivially simple so that one may debug, try and understand basic working.
The testing for this was carried out with Qt4.8
